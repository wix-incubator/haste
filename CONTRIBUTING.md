Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Submitting an Issue
Please provide us with an issue in case you've found a bug, want a new feature, have an awesome idea, or there is something you want to discuss.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Haste. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.
